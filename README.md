# Implicit_Intent

Explicit intents:
specify the component to start by name (the fully-qualified class name). You'll typically use an explicit 
intent to start a component in your own app, because you know the class name of the activity or service you want to start. 
For example, starting an activity within the app.

Implicit intents:
do not name a specific component, but instead declare a general action to perform, which allows a component from another app
to handle it.
For example, opening a URL, the u'll get the choice of browsers available on device.
